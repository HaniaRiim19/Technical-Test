You will find the SQL SP in this reposity

Exercise 2 was executed successfully
Currently on my device i use this link to see the results:
http://localhost:5022/

There's an issue with Exercise 3 as Visual Studio is not readily available for Mac (it's deprecated), I used VS Code for this project which made it a little harder to set up the MVC Framework. It should have been possible to access the result with this link

http://localhost:5022/http://localhost:5022/ClassReport

There's been an issue with the display.
